## Inspiration
This project was inspired by my own dream of owning a home. I wanted to create a website that would allow people to design their dream home, no matter what their budget or lifestyle.

## Design
The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. The home design page is interactive, allowing users to drag and drop different elements to create their dream home.

</div>

## Technology
The website is built using React.js, Node.js, and SQL. React.js is a JavaScript library that is used to create user interfaces. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used to create web servers. SQL is a database language that is used to store and retrieve data.

## Future Plans
I plan to continue to develop the website and add new features. I would also like to make the website available on mobile devices.
